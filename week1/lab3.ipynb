       "- **Religious views:** Many religions propose that life’s purpose is connected to fulfilling a divine plan, spiritual growth, or preparing for an afterlife.\n",
       "- **Scientific views:** From a biological standpoint, the meaning of life can be seen as survival and reproduction, passing on genes to the next generation.\n",
