    "Pushover is a nifty tool for sending Push Notifications to your phone.\n",

    "1. The User token which you get from the home page of Pushover\n",
    "2. The Application token which you get by going to https://pushover.net/apps/build and creating an app   \n",
    "\n",
    "(This is so you could choose to organize your push notifications into different apps in the future.)\n",
