Its first product was Markellm, the marketplace connecting consumers with insurance providers. The company experienced rapid growth in its first five years, expanding its product portfolio to include Carllm (auto insurance portal), Homellm (home insurance portal), and Rellm (enterprise reinsurance platform). By 2020, Insurellm had reached a peak of 200 employees with 12 offices across the US. However, the company underwent a strategic restructuring in 2022-2023 to focus on profitability and sustainable growth. This included consolidating office locations, implementing a remote-first strategy, and streamlining operations. As of 2025, Insurellm operates with a lean, highly efficient team of 32 employees who have built a portfolio of 32 active contracts spanning all eight product lines. The company maintains its San Francisco headquarters along with small satellite offices in key markets including New York, Austin, Chicago, and Denver. Since the restructuring, Insurellm has continued to innovate, expanding its product suite to eight comprehensive platforms.'),\n",
